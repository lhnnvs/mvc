                    <p><b>Acceptance of Terms</b><br>
                        By accessing or using our Smart Rental Locker service, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use our lockers.</p>

                    <p><b>Contact Information</b><br>
                        To rent a locker, you will need to provide your name and contact number. This information will be used solely for sending notifications or alerts regarding your rental.</p>

                    <p><b>Rental Period</b><br>
                        Lockers are available for rental for specified time periods. You agree to return the locker by the end of the rental period.</p>

                    <p><b>Grace Period</b><br>
                        A grace period of 24 hours will be allowed after the end of the rental period. If you do not retrieve your belongings by the end of the grace period, your items will be placed in our lost and found. If the items are not claimed within three months, we reserve the right to dispose of or donate them.</p>

                    <p><b>Unclaimed Belongings and Retrieval Fees</b><br>
                        If you fail to retrieve your belongings by the end of the rental period and the 24-hour grace period, your items will be placed in our lost and found. You may still retrieve your belongings, but a retrieval fee will apply if the grace period has passed. The fee schedule is as follows:<br>

                            • 1st Offense: Retrieval fee of P100 will apply.<br>
                            • 2nd Offense: Retrieval fee of P100 will apply, plus a penalty of P50.<br>
                            • 3rd Offense: Retrieval fee of P200 will apply, and you will be permanently banned from using our service.</p>
                            
                    <p><b>Banning Policy</b><br>
                    After the third offense of failing to retrieve your belongings within the designated time, you will be permanently banned from renting lockers with us. All rental privileges will be revoked, and you will not be allowed to use our service again.</p>

                    <p><b>Payment</b><br>
                        All fees for locker rentals must be paid in advance. We accept payments via cash or GCash, and you are responsible for any applicable taxes or charges.</p>

                    <p><b>Prohibited Items</b><br>
                        You are prohibited from storing hazardous materials, perishable items, illegal substances, or any other items deemed inappropriate by us. We reserve the right to open lockers and dispose of prohibited items.</p>

                    <p><b>Liability</b><br>
                        We are not liable for any loss, theft, or damage to items stored in the lockers; use our service at your own risk. We recommend not storing valuables.</p>

                    <p><b>Termination</b><br>
                        We reserve the right to terminate your access to the service for any reason, including violation of these terms or other unacceptable behavior.</p>

                    <p><b>Changes to Terms</b><br>
                        We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Your continued use of the service after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
